@c Permute

The @code{permute} transformation interchanges the loops of a loop nest.

@deftypefn {Transform} @code{permute} {} (int @var{stmt} = 0, int @var{level} = 0, Vector @var{p})

The loop nest to permute is specified by @var{stmt} and @var{level}. The loops in the next are permuted acording to the vector @var{p}.
